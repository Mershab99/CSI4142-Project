#### NOTE: The clickhouse connection is not reliable so some visualizations may show up as "No Data!". Please be patient and refresh, or try again in a few moments. We PROMISE every visualization works and has data behind it!

We believe this is due to the third party JDBC Driver that Metabase uses to connect to clickhouse.

## Jupyter Notebook Instructions

#### Please Read **BEFORE** Running Jupyter Notebooks!

- Download the datasets here: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SJtowq7BtmNrD8x_OwQU8YuMUtQ4u9WG?usp=drive_link)
- Create a folder named `data` in the root of the project
- Extract and place the source data in the `data` folder.
    - The subdirectory should have each dimension data in it in order for the jupyter notebooks to work.
- Execute the notebooks!

#### NOTE: Again, The clickhouse connection is not reliable so some cells may fail, and will have to be re-run.
